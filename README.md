# OmniROM
A repo that holds the PCSX2 .bats for compressiong roms (It can be used for PSX, PSP and Sega Dreamcast Games)
They are from [here](https://u.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=kZDH81kZHH9txOzWRSfidhxYhMviSYe30lW7#/filemanager?folder=5430730234) but for ease of use, I wanna also hold them here


# SIDE NOTE

If you used [OPL-Manager](https://oplmanager.com/site/) to dump yourgames, and then you used OmniROM to compress them, It can have issues, the first one being that you can go from .chd-.cso in most cases, I tried and no luck for my usecase
